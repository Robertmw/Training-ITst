## Intro

If we want to develop a static website, we will create a set of HTML pages linked to each other. Whenever a user navigates from one page to another a request for the new page is sent to the server and the new requested HTML page is sent back to the client. 

Whenever user requests for a page, the server generates an HTML from these server pages and send back the response HTML to the browser.
